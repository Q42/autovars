  <h1>Demonstrates AutoVars sparse rendering</h1>
  <p>
    Move your mouse cursor over either table to move the red column. It should
    stay close to your cursor. If both tables respond fluently on your hardware,
    try increasing the table size in App.jsx. Conversely, if both are too slow,
    try a smaller table size.

    <b>The effect is even clearer when you open the developer console.</b>

    This example simulates a complex webapp with leaf components that apply
    logic on state that centrally managed. We developed this for a car
    configurator (https://configurator.mazda.nl) where many things change based
    on a single click.
  </p>
  <p>
    React is built to quickly rerender subtrees, but in our case that approach
    isn't sufficient because many components derive their state from the
    centrally managed state. Deriving that state costs CPU cycles. Therefore
    preventing rerenders in that case will improve user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using something like Flux can make the ReactTable more performant, but since
    it will not skip lambda calculations and rerenders like AutoVars, it will
    still be slower. I welcome PRs with better implementations though!
